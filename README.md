# OdourCollect

OdourCollect is the App to report your odour complaints. Use the power of your nose: Smell and share!

Have you ever experience odour nuisance at home or at your working place? Do you know where to set up a complaint? Frequent exposure to annoying odours can cause headache, stress or lack of concentration, thus reducing your quality of life. Even though odour complaints are one of the main environmental problems in the EU, there is not specific legislation to control the problem, meaning that citizens are defenceless!

OdourCollect provides a tool to empower citizens, who are suffering from regular odour nuisance, to report the incidence to the world. Odour maps are build based on crowd-sourced odour reports to calculate frequencies and levels of nuisance. Just log in and start reporting, anytime, everywhere! Your nose is indeed the best odour sensor available. Resulting odour maps are open for public consultation and could eventually be used to demonstrate the problem and ask for action to the relevant stakeholders, with the aim of eliminating or significantly reducing the nuisance, thus improving your quality of life.

The project has been developed within the following frames:

MYGEOSS, a two-year European project (2015-2016) by the European Commission to develop GEOSS-based (Global Earth Observation System of Systems) smart Internet applications informing European citizens on the changes affecting their local environment. OdourCollect was one of the 66 winners from 15 European countries of the third MYGEOSS open call for innovative ideas.

D-NOSES (Distributed Network for Odour Sensing, Empowerment and Sustainability). OdourCollect validated its bottom-up methodology in 10 pilot settings across 10 countries (Spain, Portugal, Greece, Bulgaria, Chile, Italy, UK, Germany, Austria and Uganda). DNOSES received funding from the European’s Union Horizon 2020 Science with & for Society Call (SwafS) under grant agreement No. 789315.

OdourCollect has also received support and funding from FECYT (Spanish Fundation for Science and Technology – Ministry of Science and Innovation).
